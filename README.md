# Medical Response Finder
The Medical Response Finder app allows medical staff and healthcare facilities to locate team members for assistance.

## Problem
Healthcare facilities in areas heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic are increasingly in need of medical workers; this is especially
true for hot-spots like New York City, which continues to set-up temporary facilities to respond to the novel virus. Likewise, nurses and 
other practioners in less-stressed markets are being furloughed or seeing their hours cut as to cope with patient 
reductions stemming from (necessary) social-distancing practices.

## Solution
This app helps connect the areas in need and with those available to assist. The main focus of this applications is to provide a clear 
visual map of what is available to all users on the service portal.  Also, a quick and easy signup process through a catalog item which 
triggers a workflow and approval process.

## Competitive Landscape
The app hopes to serve as more rapid alternative to temping agencies and traditional networking platforms such as LinkedIn and Monster.com
by connecting professionals directly with hiring managers through a simple to use application.
